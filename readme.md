# Maysara Al Jumaily COSC 5P30 Final project

The project has been hosted on Colab using Python 3.10.12 for the sake of simply running the implementation of the code through [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oi4Kut5h2SLWr7nr-0V1MJ0-zTKaNju8](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oi4Kut5h2SLWr7nr-0V1MJ0-zTKaNju8). In case the wish is to run it locally, then please install GraphiQ using `pip install graphiq` and run the code found in `implementation.py` file.

## How to Execute Colab
In order to run the Colab implementation, the first cell is the most important because it sets the number of isomorphic graphs to generate. It is set to two by default `n: int=2`. It is encouraged to use a single digit integer as the execution time will be long. Approximately, each isomorphic graph generated will take approximately 30 seconds to execute. You are welcome to add more gates in the last cell.


## How to Execute Locally
Once everything is installed, download the `implementation.py` file, which is attached in this repository and execute it. In `implementation.py`, [line 386](https://github.com/Aljumaily/COSC5P30/blob/c0452e09204543f57fd07e326636cef72d19681c/implementation.py#L386) has the number of isomorphic graphs to generate as `n=2`. Change as desired.
